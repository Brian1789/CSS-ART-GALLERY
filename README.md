This project showcases a collection of visual creations made purely with HTML and CSS. Each artwork is displayed in a modern, responsive grid layout. Users can view the source code for each piece with syntax highlighting and smooth transitions.

## Features

## How to Use

2. Browse the gallery and click “View Code” under any artwork to see its HTML/CSS source.

## Customization
